            <h1>HIMALAYAS</h1>
            <p>
                The name of the range derives from the Sanskrit Himālaya (हिमालय 'abode of the snow'), from himá (हिम 'snow') and ā-laya (आलय 'receptacle, dwelling').[7] They are now known as "the Himalaya Mountains", usually shortened to "the Himalayas". Following the etymology some writers refer to it as the Himalaya. This was also previously transcribed as Himmaleh, as in Emily Dickinson's poetry[8] and Henry David Thoreau's essays.
